Practical use of the program:
You drink a certain number of cups of tea every day. 
This program will allow you, running this file daily at the end of the day and entering the value of tea consumed, as well as distributing the tea consumed into 4 categories, save the values and keep track of the tea you have drunk since a certain date.

Indicate on the 4th line of the "tea.py" file the starting date of the tea consumed.
If the first request of the program to specify the number "0", the program will reset the entire counter.
If the first program request indicates the number "1000", the program will simply display all the stored values.
